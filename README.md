# Weather-app

We will use the Yahoo weather API to make a weather widget. given design screen to work on the webpage. By default, we see the 5-day weather forecast for Davis.

Pushing the arrow on the right moves all the days one over to the left, so that today disappears and we see the five days following today. A left arrow should appear to let the user shift back, as well. Here are some hints on that.
We have ten days of forecast total, so after pushing the right arrow five times, the right arrow should disappear, leaving the left arrow.
Entering a place name or a zip code in the box at the bottom should either switch to showing the weather for that place, or leave the display the same an put up a message saying the place was not found.
